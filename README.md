Comparing Random Effects, Fixed Effects and Within-Between Random Effect models 

This repository contains the code my report "Comparing Fixed Effects, Random Effects and Within-Between Random Effect Models." The data used can be shared if neeeded.  In this report, I review differences between  methods commonly used to analyze longitudinal data. The post includes review of the methods, differences in the estimates and a comparison on the models performance. This report was completed entirely in R.

The project covers the theoretical concepts and applications of the following topics:
- Fixed Effects
- Random Effects
- Mixed-Effects
- Out-of-sample predictions
- Exploratory analysis and visualizations
